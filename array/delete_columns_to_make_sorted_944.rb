# We are given an array A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same length.
#
# Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the characters in those indices.
#
# For example, if we have an array A = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is ["bef", "vyz"], and the remaining columns of A are ["b","v"], ["e","y"], and ["f","z"].  (Formally, the c-th column is [A[0][c], A[1][c], ..., A[A.length-1][c]].)
#
# Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, each remaining column in A is in non-decreasing sorted order.
#
# Return the minimum possible value of D.length.

a = ["abc", "bcd", "afg"]
a = ["www", "xxx", "yyy"]
a = ["rrjk","furt","guzm"]

# @param {String[]} a
# @return {Integer}

# 1. Break strings to array of chars
# 2. Access char columns and compare next row of char
# 3. if 1st char is > than 2nd char, increment delete count, break loop
# 4. cont check next column
# 5. return delete count
