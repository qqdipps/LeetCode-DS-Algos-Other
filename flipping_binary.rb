# Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, 
# then invert it, and return the resulting image.

# To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image 
# is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally
# results in [0, 1, 1].

# To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, 
# and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] 
# results in [1, 0, 0].

# @param {Integer[][]} a
# @return {Integer[][]}
